# Zero-Trust Kubectl Access Proxy Goes Open-Source

We've posted before about how ZTKA is one of the most utilized features of our platform. Now, we've decided to take this tool open-source.

<!--truncate-->

Our customers have loved ZTKA because it:

- Enables devops to meet security goals without bogging down developers
- Cleanly plugs into existing k8s workflows
- Centralizes logging and auditing

These concepts of security, ergonomics, interoperability, and accountability have made the tool successful, and it's no coincidence they are also common values in the FOSS community.

We hope that open-sourcing ZTKA will allow security-minded devs the freedom to experiment with how it can make their zero-trust ambitions doable. It will be easier for a single engineer to drive adoption of zero-trust practices now that they can try ZTKA at any of the integration levels it supports. This is _without_ going through a lengthy procurement process and _with_ full visibility of the implementation.

This move will also make it easier to speak directly with devs about their usage preferences, beloved features, or complaints. Our internal engineers will be monitoring and responding to issues, and later releases will reflect this. In the future, we might even see some external pull requests!
